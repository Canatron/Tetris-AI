A JavaScript version of the videogame Tetris, but with an toggle-able AI which can play well and very fast! It works by checked out all of the possible spots and rotations it could put each next peice, and using a scoring algorithm I wrote, it selects the best option and plays the move.

You can disable the AI with the press of a button and play yourself using the arrow keys or WASD.

The p5.js javascript library was used to make creating the graphics, input controls and UI easier.
